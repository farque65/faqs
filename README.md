# FAQ

## What is FAQ?
FAQ is a simple app that returns answers to a user submitted query.

## Intended Use
All FAQ threads are to be managed via the Django admin portal. The user facing
page has a simple user input search bar and a section where the results are
returned. 

## Technologies
ReactJS manages most of the front-end rendering where possible and Django
handles the rest. Django is the primary backend framework and connects to
Postgres where the fetching and storing of data are.
